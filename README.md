🚀 **About Me**

I'm a backend and blockchain engineer with over 5 years of experience building secure, scalable systems for enterprise and decentralized environments. Recently, I completed my MSc in Cyber Security from Coventry University with Distinction, gaining hands-on experience in ethical hacking, threat modeling, and secure application design.

My work spans a wide range of domains — from cloud-native backend services and blockchain smart contracts to AI-powered intrusion detection systems. I love turning complex problems into elegant solutions, and I thrive in fast-moving environments where impact matters.
